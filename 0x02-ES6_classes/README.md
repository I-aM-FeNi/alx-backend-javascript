#ALX Backend JavaScript - ES6 Classes

##Overview

This project focuses on the concept of classes and inheritance in `ECMAScript 6 (ES6)`. The tasks are designed to help you grasp the usage of classes, symbols, and methods while understanding how inheritance works in JavaScript. Each task involves implementing specific functionality that builds upon these concepts.

##Objectives
```
Understand and implement ES6 classes in JavaScript.
Use getter and setter methods for encapsulating class data.
Understand and implement class inheritance and polymorphism.
Learn to use Symbols in JavaScript for creating private properties.
Implement cloning and privacy features using ES6 classes.
```

##Requirements
```
All your files should be executable and run in a Node.js environment.
Code must follow the latest ECMAScript standards.
Classes must be used for object-oriented design and manipulation.
Proper use of getter and setter methods to interact with object properties.
Use of JavaScript Symbols to create private properties in classes.
```

##Tasks Breakdown

###Task 0: You Used to Attend a Holberton School?

Implement a class HolbertonCourse with attributes such as name, length, and students. This task tests the basics of class structure, encapsulation, and input validation.

###Task 1: Let's Make Some Rooms!

Implement a class ClassRoom and a function initializeRooms that returns an array of ClassRoom objects. This task focuses on initializing objects and understanding class constructors.

###Task 2: A Course, Getters, and Setters

Enhance the HolbertonCourse class to use getter and setter methods for encapsulating its attributes. This task tests the use of getters and setters in ES6.

###Task 3: Methods, Static Methods, Computed Methods Names

Implement a class Currency with attributes and methods to handle currency conversions. This task demonstrates how to work with computed method names and static methods.

###Task 4: Pricing

Create a Pricing class that uses the Currency class to define pricing for products in different currencies. This task highlights the use of classes for business logic encapsulation.

###Task 5: A Building

Define a Building class with an abstract method evacuationWarningMessage. This task introduces abstract classes and methods in JavaScript.

###Task 6: Inheritance

Create a SkyHighBuilding class that extends the Building class and overrides its methods. This task demonstrates inheritance and method overriding.

###Task 7: Airport

Implement a class Airport that stores information about airports, including their location. This task emphasizes object encapsulation and property management in ES6 classes.

###Task 8: Primitive - Holberton Founder

Override JavaScriptâ€™s primitive methods in a class HolbertonFounder. This task explores customizing how objects behave when converted to strings or numbers.

###Task 9: Hoisting

Fix the hoisting issue in a provided class implementation. This task tests your understanding of hoisting behavior in JavaScript classes.

###Task 10: Vroom

Implement a Car class with a cloneCar method that returns a new instance of the class. This task introduces cloning objects with class methods.

###Task 11: EVCar

Extend the Car class to create an EVCar class. Ensure that when cloning an EVCar, it returns an instance of Car instead of EVCar. This task focuses on inheritance and privacy features in ES6 classes.

##Conclusion

This project covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming using ES6 classes, focusing on class inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, and the use of symbols for privacy. Mastering these concepts will help you design scalable and maintainable code in JavaScript.
